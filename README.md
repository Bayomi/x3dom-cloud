## VRML Viewer


### Description

A professor from the Civil Engineering departments holds a lecture on Virtual and Augmented Reality. He used an old application that could read .vrml files. The application is not supported anymore. Then, I worked with a colleague to implement a real-time web version of a vrml viewer, transforming .vrml into X3D and showing an instantaneous 3D model of the code.
